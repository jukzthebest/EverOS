"""Cascade handlers — one per kind, sharing the :class:`Handler` chassis.

Four daily-log handlers (episode / atomic_fact / foresight /
agent_case) inherit :class:`BaseDailyLogHandler` for the shared
read / diff / upsert / delete loop; the per-kind subclass only
declares its repo binding and ``_build_row`` mapping. ``agent_skill``
and ``user_profile`` stand alone — they're single-file kinds (no
entries, no per-entry diff), so they implement :class:`Handler`
directly and own their reconcile loop.
